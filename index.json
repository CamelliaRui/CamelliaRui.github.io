The state-of-the-art imputation reference panel released by the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) initiative improved the imputation of admixed African-ancestry and Hispanic/Latino samples, but imputation for populations primarily residing outside of North America may still fall short in performance due to persisting underrepresentation. To illustrate this point, we imputed the genotypes of over 43,000 individuals across 123 populations around the world and identified numerous populations where imputation accuracy paled in comparison to that of European-ancestry populations. For instance, the mean imputation r-squared (Rsq) for variants with minor allele frequencies between 1% and 5% in Saudi Arabians (n = 1,061 …","tags":null,"title":"Imputation accuracy across global human populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Your Category"],"content":"","date":1710979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710979200,"objectID":"09e85c916b108980fa0a63274c298008","permalink":"https://CamelliaRui.github.io/post/my-linkedin-post1/","publishdate":"2024-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/my-linkedin-post1/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":["linkedin","your-tags"],"title":"TA for LA's Best","type":"post"},{"authors":["Tsz Fung Chan","Xinyue Rui","et al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"86790bd3b6ba7feab26e9ab5acc108d2","permalink":"https://CamelliaRui.github.io/publication/heritability/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heritability/","section":"publication","summary":"The heritability explained by local ancestry markers in an admixed population provides crucial insight into the genetic architecture of a complex disease or trait. Estimation can be susceptible to biases due to population structure in ancestral populations. Here, we present heritability estimation from admixture mapping summary statistics (HAMSTA), an approach that uses summary statistics from admixture mapping to infer heritability explained by local ancestry while adjusting for biases due to ancestral stratification. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that HAMSTA estimates are approximately unbiased and are robust to ancestral stratification compared to existing approaches. In the presence of ancestral stratification, we show a HAMSTA-derived sampling scheme provides a calibrated family-wise error rate (FWER) of ∼5% for admixture mapping, unlike existing FWER estimation …","tags":null,"title":"Estimating heritability explained by local ancestry and evaluating stratification bias in admixture mapping from summary statistics","type":"publication"}]
